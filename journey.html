                    Suppose you are beginning a journey to a beautiful mountain you can see clearly in the distance.
                    No sooner do you start the hike you walk right into a swamp that extends as far as you can see in all directions. 
                    <br><br>

                    You say to yourself,
                    "I didn't realise that I was going to have to go through a swamp. It's all smelly, and the mud is all over my shoes.
                    It's hard to lift my feet out of the mud and put them forward. I'm wet and tired. Why didn't anyone tell me about this swamp?"
                    <br><br>
                    
                    When that happens, you have a choice:<br>
                    Abandon the journey or
                    enter the swamp.
                    <br><br>

                    Life is like that.
                    We go into the swamp, 
                    not because we want to get muddy,
                    but because it stands between us 
                    and where we are going. 
                      
                </p>
